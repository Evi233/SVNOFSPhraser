# **[ARCHIVED] - Repository with License Issues**

> **This repository has been archived due to concerns raised about its originality and potential license violations (GPLv3) related to the SVKey project.**

## Statement

This code was originally downloaded from the `opensynthv/NOFSPraser` project before it disappeared. I am not the original author.

It has been brought to my attention that the code bears significant similarity to the SVKey project (licensed under GPLv3), which I was previously unaware of.

This repository is now archived permanently. Please refer to the original SVKey project for the canonical source.

**I do not grant any license for the use of this code.**


1. This project was "downloaded" (who knows how I did it, 
"git clone" or 
"download zip") by me from 
"opensynthv/NOFSPraser" (or a similar username). Since the original project disappeared, I re-uploaded my local version to this repository.
2. Initially, I was just interested in SynthV's implementation methods, found this project, and only changed the variable names from 
"Chinese_pinyin" to 
"Chinese" based on my own understanding. I did nothing else. However, after realizing it was useless to me, I left it here and forgot about it. A few days ago, I suddenly received an issue. So I set the repository to private, thought about it, then cleared the commit history, and set it back to public to make this statement.
3. I learned about Yu Corp weeks later, but as I said, I had forgotten about this repository. I never knew the Yu key was open-source, and even if I had known, I wouldn't have been able to understand it. I don't know C language; I only own a genuine copy of SynthV and the Mai voice bank.
4. I am not a programmer, just an ordinary person who is okay at using Copilot—pure vibe coding. I only know Python. The released version was also merged by AI. Therefore, I do not accept issues because I cannot address them. GitHub is just an online backup drive for me to prevent data loss (my hard drive unfortunately broke just a week ago—so thanks, GitHub!).
5. Regarding the license issue, I followed a Bilibili link to find the suspected original author but received no reply.

Anyway, this is just a tragedy of forgetting to set the repository to private.
